    "[Helgadottir, Argun, and Volpe (2019)](https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-6-4-506) described the convolutional neural network architecture that they created and trained. The diagram summarising the structure of this network from their paper is shown here:\n",

    "In summary this network takes an image 51 x 51 pixels as input and passes it through 3 convolutional layers. Effectively these redescribe the images as features. There are then two densly connected layers which finally connect to a 3 value output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The first convolutional layer runs 16 3 x 3 kernels over the image, producing 16 channels of size 49 x 49.\n",
    "   * Each of these channels is like a map of intensity for a different feature, perhaps a top edge for example. During training the network learns the weights for these kernels. In effect it learns what features are important for it to minimise error in the output.\n",
    "   * In between the red layers are max-pooling layers that downsample the channels.\n",
    "   * it is typical for the list of features (i.e. number of channels) to rise as we go deeper. This is like detecting richer more complex features as we go along)"
